<h2>General <strong>Information</strong></h2>

<p>
  What is Big Data? What are data analytics? How are they being used in ways
  practical to scientists and (especially) engineers? This workshop will be
  an overview of the field and its jargon and practices—to answer, in short:
  where do I even get started?
</p>

<p>
  This example-driven three-day research workshop, hosted by
  <a href="http://cse.illinois.edu">Computational Science and Engineering</a>
  at the University of Illinois, will introduce researchers to Big Data.
  Short tutorials alternate with hands-on practical exercises, and
  participants are encouraged both to help one another, and to try applying
  what they have learned to their own research problems during and between
  sessions. Participants should bring their own laptops to work on—contact
  <a href="mailto:davis68@illinois.edu">Neal Davis</a> if you need special
  accomodation.
</p>

<p>
  The target audience is academic and industrial researchers in the hard
  sciences and engineering who are interested in analyzing and exploiting
  "Big Data" to further their insight into processes and structures. The
  workshop will focus on real research questions and how data analytics
  provides a chance to progress. It will teach participants the know-how
  and tools to begin using data analytics in their research.
</p>

<p>
  Many of the tutorials and exercises will be built around practical
  examples using real-world data.  The syllabus for this workshop will
  tentatively include:
  <ul>
    <li>28 May • introduction, architecture, Hadoop MapReduce, Hadoop Streaming</li>
    <li>29 May • public data sets, data cleaning and mining, replicability of studies</li>
    <li>30 May • data visualization, machine learning, open questions</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Lunch will be provided during the three main days of the workshop.
