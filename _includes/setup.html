<p>
  Participants who wish to participate in hands-on elements should bring a
  laptop with VirtualBox or a compatible virtualization program installed.
  The VM image can be downloaded here as we draw closer to the event.
  Please download and test it prior to the start of the workshop.
</p>

<h3><strong>Software</strong> Packages</h3>
<div class="span4">
  <h4><strong>Virtual Machine</strong></h4>
  <p>
    Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.
    Download our <a href="{{site.vm_url}}">VM image</a>.
    <strong>Warning:</strong> this file is quite large,
    so please download it <em>before</em> coming to your bootcamp.
    Load the VM into VirtualBox by selecting "Import Appliance"
    and loading the <code>.ova</code> file.
  </p>
  <h4><a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/"><img src="img/hadoop-logo.jpg" /></a> MapReduce</h4>
  <p>
    <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/">Apache Hadoop</a> is a software
    framework for running certain types of highly parallel jobs across
    distributed clusters with a simple programming model.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will utilize a distribution of Hadoop made available on AWS EC2.
  </p>
  <h4>Amazon Web Services <strong>Elastic Cloud Compute</strong> (EC2)</h4>
  <p>
    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Serices</a> is one of the
    major infrastructure and service providers of cloud computing today.
    The EC2 service allows users to create an array of virtual servers,
    run a map/reduce-style algorithm across the system, and process their
    data efficiently.
  </p>
  <p>
    AWS is one of the contenders for an <a href="http://www.internet2.edu/communities-groups/members/all/level_1/">Internet2</a> contract, making it
    highly possible that this will be the settled Big Data platform at UIUC.

  <h4><strong>Python</strong></h4>
  <p>
    Python is becoming very popular in scientific computing,
    and it's a great language for teaching general programming concepts due to its easy-to-read syntax.
    We teach with Python version 2.7,
    since it is still the most widely used.
    Installing all the scientific packages for Python individually can be a bit difficult,
    so we recommend an all-in-one installer.
  </p>
  <p>  
    We will use Pandas, a data analysis module.
  </p>
  <p>
    We recommend the all-in-one scientific Python installer
    <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads.html">Anaconda</a>.
    (Installation requires using the shell and if you aren't
    comfortable doing the installation yourself just
    download the installer and we'll help you at the workshop.)
  </p>
  <ol>
      <li>
        Download the installer that matches your operating
        system and save it in your home folder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Open a terminal window.
      </li>
      <li>
        Type <pre>bash Anaconda-</pre> and then press
        tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should
        appear.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press Return. You will follow the text-only
        prompts. When there is a colon at the bottom of the
        screen press the down arrow to move down through the
        text. Type <code>yes</code> and press enter to approve
        the license. Press enter to approve the default
        location for the files. Type <code>yes</code> and
        press enter to prepend Anaconda to
        your <code>PATH</code> (this makes the Anaconda
        distribution the default Python).
      </li>
